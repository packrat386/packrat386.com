    <h1>Stuff I Made</h1>
    <p>I enjoy tinkering with code in my free time. Whether it's for their utility, or their elegance, or their expressive value, these are some pieces of code I'm pleased to have written. It's hard to call most of these things "projects" given that I rarely intend to return to them or maintain them over time, but they're generally complete enough to be used in some way.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/atalanta">atalanta</a> - I wondered what it would take to make something sorta like wikiwikiweb from scratch, and this is my best stab at it.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/agwc">agwc</a> - There's so many weather clients out there, and yet none of them do <em>exactly</em> what I want. This gets close.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/magic_words">magic_words</a> - I really don't like useless constants</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/bottomless_void">bottomless_void</a> - Learning about all the fun you can do with ruby's C API</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/isochron">isochron</a> - A ruby implementation of something sorta like Go's <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Once">sync.Once</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/catserver">catserver</a> - I wrote, ran, and deleted this many times before bothering to just put it on GitHub.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/thingdoer">thingdoer</a> - Sometimes you want it to just do the thing.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kjcjohnson/nasT">nasT</a> - A collaboration with a friend at a hackathon. We attempted to build an MVC framework using only POSIX command line utilities.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/packrat386/papadoble.net">papadoble.net</a> - I like Hemingway and I like cocktails. The site is no longer up sadly, but I dream one day of making a 2.0.</li>
