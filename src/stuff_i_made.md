# Stuff I Made

I occasionally enjoy tinkering with code in my free time. Whether it\'s
for their utility, or their elegance, or their expressive value, these
are some pieces of code I\'m pleased to have written. It\'s hard to call
most of these things \"projects\" given that I rarely intend to return
to them or maintain them over time, but they\'re generally complete
enough to be used in some way.

-   [ynal](https://github.com/packrat386/ynal) - You Need A License.
    This makes it as simple as `curl -o`
-   [kamino](https://github.com/packrat386/kamino) - I got tired of
    having a messy git repo setup on my personal laptop. This lets me be
    lazy while giving everything a simple canonical path
-   [boreas](https://github.com/packrat386/boreas) - I didn\'t want a
    dedicated app or a ton of ads for weather so I made my own very
    simple FE for the NWS weather forecasts. Live [on this
    site](https://boreas.packrat386.com/) and I use it every day.
-   [sk](https://github.com/packrat386/sk) - I write a lot of scripts
    that are worth saving to re-use but not worth their own repository.
    This is a tool to locally manage them. It was also a good excuse to
    learn how to do tab completion in bash.
-   [atalanta](https://github.com/packrat386/atalanta) - I wondered what
    it would take to make something sorta like wikiwikiweb from scratch,
    and this is my best stab at it.
-   [magic_words](https://github.com/packrat386/magic_words) - I really
    don\'t like useless constants
-   [bottomless_void](https://github.com/packrat386/bottomless_void) -
    Learning about all the fun you can do with ruby\'s C API
-   [isochron](https://github.com/packrat386/isochron) - A ruby
    implementation of something sorta like Go\'s
    [sync.Once](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Once)
-   [catserver](https://github.com/packrat386/catserver) - I wrote, ran,
    and deleted this many times before bothering to just put it on
    GitHub.
-   [thingdoer](https://github.com/packrat386/thingdoer) - Sometimes you
    want it to just do the thing.
-   [nasT](https://github.com/kjcjohnson/nasT) - A collaboration with a
    friend at a hackathon. We attempted to build an MVC framework using
    only POSIX command line utilities.
-   [papadoble.net](https://github.com/packrat386/papadoble.net) - I
    like Hemingway and I like cocktails. The site is no longer up sadly,
    but I dream one day of making a 2.0.
